## Abstract
*Anagha*  
The aim of the design project 'Raha' is to provide a recreational space for the distressed Syrian refugees in the Al Zaatari camp, Jordon, built using locally available material, i,e adobe, by the local inhabitants. Therefore, the design strives to adapt for ease of construction with these fixed boundary conditions. In order to achieve this, computational tools such as Grasshopper and Python were explored with manual evaluation of resulting outcomes. A generative design methodology is adopted that results in a coherent configuration, formation, structure and construction methodology of spaces.
