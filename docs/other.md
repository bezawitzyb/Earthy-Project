## 1_Scripts

<<<<<<< HEAD
The design process, as shown on the [design page](design.md), was developed using many grasshopper scripts.
Below we listed the most important scrips with a download link for detailed study of the project.
=======
To produce the design as shown on the [design page](design.md) a lot of scripts were used.
Below we listed the most important scripts with a download link for anybody intereseted to study them.

**Bubble diagram maker**  
<div style="text-align: justify">
To optimize the use of the syntactic tool a grasshopper script was made that takes in the information of the REL chart and processes it into dots and lines for the syntactic tool to work with.
</div>

*Fig: Dots and lines generated by the output of the REL chart, this will be input for the syntactic tool.*

*Fig: The script is used for generating the lines between the dots, based on the value implied in the REL chart.*

**Gradient descent**

**Relaxer**  
<div style="text-align: justify">
To study our tessellations and their final form a grasshopper script was made that did the relaxing.
It takes in anchor curves and the tesselation as input. After meshing the tesselation it relaxes it.
The script is illustrated in the gif below and can be downloaded below 
</div>

**Structural calculations**
<div style="text-align: justify">
The script comprises of two stages: first stage includes the analysis of the roof and the second stage includes the analysis of the walls. Additionally, python was used to check the wekaest points of the analyzed geometry and generate a new colour code for the areas which are not within the set limit states.

**Rib maker**  
<div style="text-align: justify">
This script was designed to make all the ribbed roofs for the project.
The only input it needs are the brick sizes and the curves over which it needs to place these bricks.
the gif below illustrates how the ribs are generated. The script can be downloaded below
