## 1_Scripts

To produce the design as shown on the [design page](design.md) a lot of scripts were used.
Below we listed the most important scrips with a download link for anybody intereseted to study them.

**site selector**

**Bubble diagram maker**  
<div style="text-align: justify">
To optimize the use of the syntactic tool a grasshopper script was made that takes in the information of the REL chart and processes it into dots and lines for the syntactic tool to work with.
</div>
</br>

![dots and lines for bubble diagram](rev\configuration\bubble_diagram\bubble_lines.png)
*Fig: Dots and lines generated by the output of the REL chart, this will be input for the syntactic tool.*

![script for making all this](rev\configuration\bubble_diagram\bubble_script.png)  
*Fig: The script is used for generating the lines between the dots, based on the value implied in the REL chart.*

**Gradient descent**

**Relaxer**  
<div style="text-align: justify">
To study our tessellations and there final form a grasshopper script was made that did the relaxing.
It takes in anchor curves and the tesselation as input. After meshing the tesselation it relaxes it.
The script is illustrated in the gif below and can be downloaded below </div>

*Fig: showing the process of relaxing the roof using grasshopper*

**Structural calculation**

**Rib maker**  
<div style="text-align: justify">
This script was designed to make all the ribbed roofs for the project.
The only input it needs are the brick sizes and the curves over which it needs to place these bricks.
the gif below illustrates how the ribs are generated. The script can be downloaded below
</div>
