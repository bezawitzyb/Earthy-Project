Raha is designed by a group of 5 enthusiastic students pursuing their masters education in Building Technology at the Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands. Their aligned motivation to further computational skills and its application in Architectural design/construction brought them together for this project.

Anagha Yoganand is currently pursuing MSc.Architecture, Urbanism and Building sciences under the Building Technology track. She also chairs BouT, the study association of the AE&T department at the Bouwkunde. Her academic background in Architecture and two years of practice experience in India has helped her understand the technical details and implications of attaining sustainable designs that impact the overall performance of buildings. At TU Delft she is keen to specialize in computational design and product innovation with emphasis given to optimization and evaluation of design performance.

Aspiring to become a leading Building Technologist, I am a highly motivated, hardworking individual. After pursuing my bachelors in architecture from Mumbai University, I worked as an Assistant Project Architect at SSA Architects in Mumbai for a year.
In view of widening my vistas beyond design and architecture, I was keen to pursue my masters in a technical subject which bridged the gap between an architect and an engineer. Pursuing my masters in Building Technology has helped me gain the neccesary technical knowledge and improve my software skills.

After doing his Bachelor at the Saxion hoge school in Enschede Thijmen decided to come to Delft to enroll in the Building Technology master track.
Having focused his Bachelor graduation on structural engineering he was determined to focus on broadening his knowledge about the building industry during his master study. previous to earthy he already gained knowledge about facades by following the Facade Design course and being a Facade designer in the interdisciplinary course MEGA. It was in this course where he saw the potential of computational design and wanted to learn about this. This naturally brought him to the earthy course.
