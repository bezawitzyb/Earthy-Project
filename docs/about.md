Aspiring to become a leading Building Technologist, I am a highly motivated, hardworking individual. After pursuing my bachelors in architecture from Mumbai University, I worked as an Assistant Project Architect at SSA Architects in Mumbai for a year.
In view of widening my vistas beyond design and architecture, I was keen to pursue my masters in a technical subject which bridged the gap between an architect and an engineer. Pursuing my masters in Building Technology has helped me gain the neccesary technical knowledge and improve my software skills.

After doing his Bachelor at the Saxion hoge school in Enschede Thijmen decided to come to Delft to enroll in the Building Technology master track.
Having focused his Bachelor graduation on structural engineering he was determined to focus on broadening his knowledge about the building industry during his master study. previous to earthy he already gained knowledge about facades by following the Facade Design course and being a Facade designer in the interdisciplinary course MEGA. It was in this course where he saw the potential of computational design and wanted to learn about this. This naturally brought him to the earthy course.
