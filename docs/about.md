Raha is designed by a group of 5 enthusiastic students pursuing their masters education in Building Technology at the Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands. Their aligned motivation to further computational skills and its application in Architectural design/construction brought them together for this project.

Anagha Yoganand is currently pursuing MSc.Architecture, Urbanism and Building sciences under the Building Technology track. She also chairs BouT, the study association of the AE&T department at the Bouwkunde. Her academic background in Architecture and two years of practice experience in India has helped her understand the technical details and implications of attaining sustainable designs that impact the overall performance of buildings. At TU Delft she is keen to specialize in computational design and product innovation with emphasis given to optimization and evaluation of design performance.

Aspiring to become a leading Building Technologist, she is a highly motivated, hardworking individual. After pursuing her bachelors in architecture from Mumbai University, she worked as an Assistant Project Architect at SSA Architects in Mumbai for a year.
In view of widening her vistas beyond design and architecture, she was keen to pursue her masters in a technical subject which bridged the gap between an architect and an engineer. Pursuing her masters in Building Technology has helped her gain the neccesary technical knowledge and improve her software skills.

*personal picture*

After doing his Bachelor at the Saxion hoge school in Enschede Thijmen decided to come to Delft to enroll in the Building Technology master track.
Having focused his Bachelor graduation on structural engineering he was determined to focus on broadening his knowledge about the building industry during his master study. previous to earthy he already gained knowledge about facades by following the Facade Design course and being a Facade designer in the interdisciplinary course MEGA. It was in this course where he saw the potential of computational design and wanted to learn about this. This naturally brought him to the earthy course.

**Twinkle Nathani** [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/twinkle-nathani-88036a105/)

Twinkle is a student of master track Building Technology at TU Delft. She is also the head of Media and Public Relations committee of BouT, the study association of the AE&T department at the Bouwkunde. Over the past years, she had a growing interest in the field of sustainable design. After graduating in architecture from National Institute of Technology in 2018, she worked for two years with firms specializing in earth construction and bio-climatic building design. She decided to take up this course to apply and further enhance her knowledge in design and construction of Earhy buildings through computational workflows.
