### About Zaatari
text text site study

### Problem statement
talk about the problems we hope to tackle

### Design goal
xxxxxx intervention


### Design vision
ssssss Ease construction due to unskilled whatever else

### Overall flow chart
This flowchart shows the overall procedural workflow adopted for designing Raha. The whole project is divided into four stages, Congifuration, Forming, Structuring and Constructability respectively. 

The larger division of stages offers an eventual progression of the design by keeping each stage in coherence and informed with the other to achieve a generative design.

### Site selection *Beza*
*flowchart*  
Course Brief's demand @Beza please cover these points: *Analysis: Analyse the site in terms of intensities of population, activities, highlighting the infrastructure and seeking to reveal the invisible connections as well as flows of people and goods between points of interest.
Synthesis: Interpret the analyses and put them together to form a conclusion regarding how things work right now.
Evaluation: Identify the missing buildings and the connections that need to be strengthened or improved.
Proposition: Propose a list of communal buildings or mega buildings (such as bazars) to be designed and then envision and list stages of spatial improvements that can be feasibly realized by the community.*

### Program of requirements *Thijmen*

[Click here to open the PDF](rev/configuration/Program_of_requirements.pdf)  

Having selected a site to fit the Raha building a program was developed.  
with the functions that are to be hosted in the building came also some demands on capacity, size, level of privacy, and desire for daylight. Below these choices will be explained.

<ins>Tea house</ins>  
The tea house is one of the main functions of Raha. Its purpose is to connect people and provide them with a place where they can meet and socialize.
To do so there will be two seating spaces, a public one and a private one to allow for more intimate conversations. Together they will have a capacity for 150 people. They will be located ad the southeastern part of the building to have propper daylight which helps create the ambiance required. 

There will also be a tea bar and kitchen located in this area to provide visitors with food and drinks. These functions will have to be close to a separate entrance for them to be provided with supplies. Daylight is a necessity in the kitchen but it would help to reduce the need for artificial light.

To make sure that visitors with kids are also welcomed there will be an indoor and outdoor play area for the children.

All of these functions will be connected with a courtyard, named the herbal garden this courtyard can provide herbs for the tea that is being served in the tea house. Visitors are welcome to help with the gardening of this garden.  
There will also be some toilets connected to the herbal garden.

<ins>Hammam</ins>  
The hammam is a more secluded part of the Raha building, it is there to provide comfort hygiene for male and female the layout of the hammam will be the same and as follows.  
From the Waterbody courtyard, you enter the main hall and entrance of the hammam.
Where you can get your towels and go through to the changing room to continue either to the steam room, or the public or private bath spaces.  
All of these rooms require good ventilation and daylight but are private so this should be taken into account when designing said room.  
The hammam as a whole can host up to 125 people.

<ins>Quiet area</ins>  
Also located next to the waterbody courtyard is the quiet area. The quiet area hosts the next functions.
The quiet rooms where people can come, sit, read, and enjoy a quiet space.
There is also a library to provide visitors with books to read.
And several workspaces for the visitors to use.

All of these rooms require daylight but it should not be disturbing this is why a north orientation is chosen for these rooms.  
There will also be toilets connected to the waterbody courtyard.

<ins>Entrance</ins>  
Of course the project needs an entrance, when entering the site visitors will first walk into the water fountain courtyard. From which they can choose to go to the waterbody courtyard or the herbal garden courtyard.

<ins>Service zone</ins>  
To provide all the functions from there required services like heating, water, power, storeroom, etc. There will be a service zone that has his separate entrance and is connected to the hammam, tea house, and water fountain courtyard.

### Spacial configuration

**3D Study**  

![connectivity of spaces](img/connectivity-of-spaces.gif)

It was neccesary to analyse the 2D configuration in a 3D space to determine the adjacencies and connectivity in the horizontal and the vertical plane. The outputs generated from the computational tool were used as an input for this study.

First step was to study the ratio between the built v/s unbuilt spaces and define the proportions of the unbuilt spaces depending on the widths of the adjacent built spaces.
Next step was to connect the built and the unbuilt spaces and understand the nature of the connection. This was determined by analyzing if the connection was an exterior, interior, horizontal or vertical connection. Once the connections are defined, the walls were extruded. Certain spaces like the quiet rooms, workspaces and the sheesha were placed on the first floor as the nature of the space determined it's position. As the quiet rooms and the workspaces required a quiet and calm environment and the sheesha required an open to sky configuration, the spaces were placed on the first floor.   

### Configured design

**Modular grid**    
*Twinkle*  
talk about the grid 1.2m we first choose and how it transformed into the tartan grid explain why initially bands of 600mm was assumed- based on last years reference and our room sizes. 

**Floor plans**  
show (general) floor plans and there plan evolution (study on the courtyards and therfore the configuration that was informed)
*Siteplan*  
showing the site plan of the building and its surrounding, and the orientation (start with the first one and show how it evolved)  

**Wall modules**  
explain how the walls have been designed according to the tartan grid.
including the change of wall tickness (why we choose for 600mm bands in the tartan grid)

**roof modules**  
talk about Architectural charactaristics and show the different roof modules in the plan view - 4 types Crossvaults, Square domes, Rectangular domes and Domes with Skylight
talk about how these roofs have been designed using the tarten grid
